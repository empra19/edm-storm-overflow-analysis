## Data Sources

All data is published by the **Environment Agency** under the Open Government Licence, available at the [EA Open Data portal](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/21e15f12-0df8-4bfc-b763-45226c16a8ac).

| Dataset | Notes |
|---|---|
| EDM Storm Overflow Annual Returns (2022–2024) | Primary spill frequency and duration data |
| EDM Long-term Trends | Historical context for spill averages |

> **Note on coverage:** Full national monitoring was only achieved in 2023. Pre-2023 data underrepresents actual spill activity due to incomplete monitor installation, so direct year-on-year comparisons before 2023 should be treated with caution. This project uses 2023–2024 as its primary comparison window.

Raw data files are excluded from this repository due to file size. Download EDM annual return files from the link above.
